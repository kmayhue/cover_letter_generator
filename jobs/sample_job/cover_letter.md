Hiring Manager
[Company Name]

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my enthusiastic interest in the Senior Data Engineer position at [Company Name]. With over seven years of experience architecting scalable data solutions at organizations ranging from high-growth startups like EarthOptics to global leaders like Meta, I have developed a deep expertise in building robust, production-grade data pipelines and warehouses that drive business intelligence and operational excellence.

In my most recent role as a Senior Data Engineer at EarthOptics, I spearheaded the development and management of our BigQuery data warehouse, establishing it as the central source of truth for the entire company. By leveraging dbt for sophisticated data modeling and Looker Studio for visualization, I enabled data-driven decision-making across all teams. Furthermore, I designed and implemented automated Kubernetes-based workflows for processing complex sensor and satellite imagery data, which significantly reduced manual effort and improved pipeline reliability.

During my tenure at Meta as a Data Engineer III, I architected and deployed high-scale data pipelines using Python and SQL to process user ad data. My focus was on ensuring the highest standards of data quality and reliability, powering critical Unidash dashboards that informed high-stakes analysis and decision-making. My ability to collaborate with stakeholders and implement rigorous validation checks has consistently resulted in trustworthy data environments.

Throughout my career, I have demonstrated versatility across various cloud platforms and technologies, including GCP, AWS, and Hadoop ecosystems. Whether I am automating data synchronization from APIs using Pandas or migrating legacy ETL processes to modern Customer Data Platforms, my goal is always to deliver efficient, scalable, and actionable data solutions.

I am eager to bring my technical proficiency in Python, SQL, and modern data orchestration tools to [Company Name] and contribute to the success of your data engineering initiatives. Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to the possibility of discussing how my background and skills can benefit your team.

Sincerely,

Kenny Mayhue
